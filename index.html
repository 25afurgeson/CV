    <h3>Bio</h3>

    <p>I am currently a 9th grader at Sunset Jr. High School. While being a student, I am also a Student Body Officer, and have the position of one of four SBO Vice Presidents. I feel I am a fairly rounded person. I get good grades – I’ve gotten a 4.0 every term since the beginning of 7th grade. I also am a good leader and have always been willing to help others. I have a good circle of friends at school, too. Being an Officer, I have the opportunity to put myself out there, meet new people, and really make a difference in the lives of my peers and my school.</p>
    <p>I am 15 years old and have six siblings – two of which do not live with me. In my household, I am the oldest of five kids. I love spending time with my friends and family. One thing my family and I love to do is watching movies while eating pizza, usually on Friday nights. I am definitely a perfectionist, with maybe a hint of OCD. I love to clean and organize things, and I absolutely <em>love</em> office supplies! I also like to read and decorate.</p>
